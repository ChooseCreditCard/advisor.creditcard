        <p class="hero-lead">
          “Advisors” help explain credit card terminology, rewards, fees and risks. Some are educational, some are algorithmic, and some use AI. This page explains how they operate — and what they cannot replace.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Card “Advisor”?</h2>
      <p>
        A “credit card advisor” can be a human explanation service, a structured guide, a calculator, a decision-flow system,
        or an AI model trained to summarise card documentation. Its purpose is to clarify information,
        not to choose a card on your behalf or give personalised financial advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advisor systems help you understand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>APR and interest terminology</li>
        <li>Foreign transaction fees and FX scenarios</li>
        <li>Rewards categories, multipliers and valuation</li>
        <li>Travel perks like lounges, protections and upgrades</li>
        <li>Eligibility, credit score impact and approval criteria</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They are best used as learning tools — not as decision-makers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Models -->
    <section id="models" class="section">
      <h2>How Advisory Tools Work</h2>
      <p>Most advisors fall into one of these groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Educational advisors:</strong> guide-based explanations, FAQs and structured breakdowns of card mechanics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rule-based calculators:</strong> tools that estimate rewards or compare fees using fixed assumptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data-driven comparisons:</strong> platforms that filter cards by fees, rewards, travel perks and technology features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI summarizers:</strong> chat-based systems that turn complex issuer PDFs into short, readable explanations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The quality of an advisor depends heavily on the clarity of inputs, transparency and how frequently the tool is updated.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits -->
    <section id="limits" class="section">
      <h2>Limitations of Advisory Tools</h2>
      <p>No advisor can see your full financial situation. That means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They cannot recommend a “best” card for you personally.</li>
        <li>They rely on issuers publishing accurate, current data.</li>
        <li>AI tools may misread PDFs or simplify terms too aggressively.</li>
        <li>Reward estimates can differ from real-world use.</li>
        <li>Some advisors include affiliate links or sponsored placements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Advisors should be used to sharpen your understanding — not as a substitute for reading official documentation.
