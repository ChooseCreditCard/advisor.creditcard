        <p class="hero-lead">
          When people say “talk to an advisor about credit cards”, they might mean a regulated financial adviser, a bank representative or simply an educational website. This page explains the differences and how to use each safely.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Information, Guidance and Advice – Not the Same Thing</h2>
      <p>In the card world, “advice” is often used loosely. Some sources provide only general information, others give non-personal guidance, and a smaller group offer regulated, personalised recommendations that must follow specific rules.</p>
      <p>Understanding which type you are dealing with helps you set expectations: neutral information explains how cards work, while personalised advice considers your income, debts, risk tolerance and long-term plans.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Advisor roles -->
    <section id="roles" class="section">
      <h2>Different Types of “Advisor” in the Card Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>Several actors can look like advisors from the outside, but their incentives and obligations differ.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Bank staff:</strong> Represent the issuer. They can explain their own products but are not usually independent.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparison sites:</strong> Summarise card features and fees across issuers. They may earn affiliate revenue when you click through.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent financial advisers:</strong> Offer regulated, personalised advice, sometimes including credit products as part of a broader financial plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational publishers:</strong> Provide documentation-based overviews to help you understand terminology and trade-offs.</li>
        <li><strong>Informal online voices:</strong> Blogs, forums and influencers share experiences and opinions, but they are rarely obligated to act in your best interest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Questions to Ask Any “Advisor” About Cards</h2>
      <p>Before relying on guidance, it is reasonable to ask a few simple questions: who pays them, what products they can recommend, and whether they are required to consider your full financial situation.</p>
      <p>Clear answers make it easier to combine different sources — for example, you might use neutral guides to understand concepts, comparison tools to scan the market, and a regulated adviser for complex, high-impact decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limits of What Card Advice Can Do</h2>
      <p>Even high-quality advice can’t remove uncertainty. Interest rates may change, your circumstances shift and issuers can update product terms. Good advisors emphasise these limits instead of promising guaranteed outcomes.</p>
      <p>Most card-related decisions are part of a bigger picture involving savings, income stability and other credit products. That is why broader financial planning can matter more than the fine detail of an individual reward program.</p>
